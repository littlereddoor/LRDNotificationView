LRDNavigationView
=================

A lightweight Objective-C class to create a semi-obtrusive notification view that emanates from the navigation or status bar of an iPhone or iPad application. Can be thought of along the lines of the error messages found in Tweetbot for iPhone but with the ability to pass in the title, notification message and any required notification image.
